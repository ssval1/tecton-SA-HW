# tecton-SA-HW

In this tecton repo, there are few parts (starting from Part 3, as Part 1 & 2 are mainly installation of tecton and defining data sources),

**Part 3**, the goal is to create th following feature:  

**What percentage of the transactions made at a merchant in the last 7 days were made by users who live in cities with > 10,000 residents?**

Build this feature in Tecton, using our [feature framework](https://docs.tecton.ai/latest/concepts_overview.html).  A few specifications:

* The feature should be updated **once per day**
* The feature should be materialized **to both the online and offline stores**

**Part 4**, the goal is to test the feature created:
Next, to retreive data from the feature created above.  In this part,

**Retrieve the value of the feature you just created for the merchant `fraud_Kilback and Sons` at `1 PM on August 1st, 2022` using the Tecton SDK.** 

**Part 5**, the goal is to build a realtime feature: 

**Did a transaction occur in the northern hemisphere?**
